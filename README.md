tic-tac-toe
===

# Whats in the box?
A minimal tic tac toe game based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript

# Disclaimer
- The code itself is not really documented, but come one, its tic tac toe ...
- It is written in an very functional and procedural way to keep things really simple
- The way to find the winner is very simple, though not scalable

# Why?
This is kind of a minimal simple solution for some interns at my company to give them a quick ref for a simple and minimal tic tac toe game.
